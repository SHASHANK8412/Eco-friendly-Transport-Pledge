# Backend

This is a placeholder for the backend service.

Suggested next steps:
- Decide on a stack (Node/Express, Fastify, Python/FastAPI, etc.).
- Define API routes and data model.
- Add a package manager manifest (e.g., package.json or pyproject.toml).
- Set up environment variables management (.env) and a starter server.
